Here is the oldest version of koules I found on my hardisk. It is after
2 hours of developing. You may try it on linux/svgalib but please 
copy executable to same directory as sound files before starting.

How koules were created?

Day 1:

1) I wanted to learn svgalib
2) I did simple program for drawing line
3) I extended it to draw a circle
4) I tryed framebuffering and moved circle around screen
5) I tryed keyboard handling and did simple moving of line using arrow keys
6) I decided to make simple asteroids clone and added other circles around
7) I was lazy to do firing so I did bouncing because I like xball :)
8) I did better graphics....
9) I added bballs because the game was too simple
10)I added extensions because the game was too hard
11)My sister enjoyed the game :)))

Day 2:

1) I extended it for more players and did normal control of ships - no 
   rotational keyboard anymore
2) I played with constants and did game more addictive
3) I brought it to my friend and we played it for about four hours.
   We added level counting and increasing of difficulty
4) I decided to make intro as tie fighter parody...
5) I returned to home and started coding atarwars scroller

Day 3:

1) I brought to my friend new version with starwars scroller
2) We did first version of intro text.
3) We played a lot
4) We added intro texts for bballs
5) We played a lot...

Next days we played game and did lots of another extensions....
